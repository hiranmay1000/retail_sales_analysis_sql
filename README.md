## Steps Performed

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Identified and removed rows with NULL values to ensure data consistency.
```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR sale_time IS NULL
    OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR age IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR price_per_unit IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

### 2. **Data Exploration**
- View raw data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales LIMIT 10;
```
- Total transactions:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM retail_sales;
```
- Unique customers:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers FROM retail_sales;
```
- Distinct categories:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
```

## Business Queries and Insights

### 1. Sales on a Specific Date
Retrieve all columns for sales made on `2022-11-05`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

### 2. High Quantity Clothing Sales in November 2022
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    category = 'Clothing' AND
    quantity >= 4 AND
    sale_date >= '2022-11-01' AND
    sale_date < '2022-12-01';
```

### 3. Total Sales by Category
```sql
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

### 4. Average Age of Customers in 'Beauty' Category
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS average_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

### 5. High-Value Transactions
Find transactions with `total_sale > 1000`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

### 6. Transactions by Gender and Category
```sql
SELECT
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender;
```

### 7. Best-Selling Month in Each Year
```sql
WITH RankedSales AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)
            ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC
        ) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date)
)
SELECT year, month, avg_sale
FROM RankedSales
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 8. Top 5 Customers by Total Sales
```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 9. Unique Customers by Category
```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

### 10. Orders by Shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
```sql
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) <= 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) > 12 AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) <= 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS shift
FROM retail_sales;
```
